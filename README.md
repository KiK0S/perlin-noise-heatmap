# Perlin-noise-heatmap

In this repo you can find perlin noise vizualization. It was made as an [computer graphics assignment](https://github.com/lisyarus/graphics-course-slides/blob/master/2022/pdf/homework1.pdf).

With arrows UP/DOWN you can change resolution, with +/- you can add more isolines.

Keywords: Marching squares, perlin noise, OpenGL

## Demo

Here it is! Better launch it yourself, mp4 had tough time with capturing
